### Intro
    The intent here is to show proficiency in building some K8 resources from scratch using Azure DevOps pipelines & Terraform deploying to Azure

### TODO
    Understand and decide overall architecture. 
    Actually make the arch diagrams and link them here
    Lay out how-to for auth >> SPNs from AzDO to Azure
    Lay out how-to for tf remote backend & why
    Build out a basic pipeline which can run some terraform plan & apply's
    Start building out TF - first any core infra then application stack
    Find interesting or pre-built containers that I could run - start building out a 3 tier app?
    Start building out a wide microservices app - lots of nodes running lots of different microservices
