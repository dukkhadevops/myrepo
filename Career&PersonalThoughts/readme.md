# Hello & Welcome
I thought this might be a spot that, since I'm introducing you to a little bit of my work I may as well take the opportunity to introduce you to my thought process around my career... what makes me tick, what I pay attention to, my influences, what I'm learning etc. So hello and welcome! I consider myself lucky that you're intersted enough in my background to be reading more about me, so thank you. I hope you learn something or this at least sparks something in you to start thinking more deeply about your own personal journey. Onward and upward!

## Pillars of Thought - How I aspire to live my life & approach my career
- The essence of life is growth - to do the best you possibly can. Make as many friends as you can, read as many books as you can, develop as many skills as you can, see as much as possible, do as much as possible. The max - there's no life like it. -Jim Rohn

- The only sustainable competitive advantage is your ability to learn faster than the competition. -Arie de Gues

- Success is something you attract by the person you become. Take full responsibility for where you are and who you are. If you will change, everything will change for you. To have more you have to become more. Don't wish it were easy, wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills. -Jim Rohn

- DevOps is an approach to more than just software. Deploy new changes. Measure them. Assess how they went. Formulate a newer and better plan. Plug in what you've learned to the beginning of your process and begin anew. Fail faster and shift left whether thats your career or personal life.  

- Durable skills stay with you and allow you to meet new challenges time and again. Technical skills are great, thats probably why we got into the field to begin with but soft skills are durable. Challenge yourself to to approach your soft skills and emotional IQ with the same rigor as your technical skills.

- Guard your time - guard your headspace - cut out the bullshit & negativity. There is so much noise out there that if you don't guard your little kingdom of thought you'll end up adrift in an ocean of bs with no direction. If you have negative people in life dragging you down, cut them out. If what you're doing with your free time isn't bringing you joy and re-energizing you then what is all your hard work for? Turn off the news. Turn off your phone. Trim down the voices in your head and in your life that aren't moving you forward. Turn up the volume of your influences & positive people in your life that inspire you and fill your soul so you jump out of bed in the morning ready to attack the day.

## Build a Vision
From Mike Pfeiffer - treat your career like a company. What Problem are you trying to solve? What is your Mission? What is your Vision for your career? What are your core Values? Build a personal brand. I'm still building mine but I've got a good starting point for core values.

My Core Values
- High standards. Great isn't good enough. All work and effort is world-class.
- Ownership. No excuses, don't blame others. Own the problem, be resourceful and deliver.
- Decisiveness. Speed matters. Commit and work your tail off until the problem is solved.
- Focus. Keep the main thing the main thing. Ruthlessly eliminate distraction.
- Long-Term Thinking. Make short-term sacrifices for long-term success.
- Mastery. Leave no stone unturned. Commit to fully understanding a problem and solution. Don't dabble in many things, master a few.
